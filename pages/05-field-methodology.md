Prior to commencing fieldwork, there are procedures and processes that must be followed to ensure a successful campaign. Checklists for tasks (e.g. Supp. 1) and equipment (Supp. 2 and Fig. 2), will assist in this process.


## Before the dive

There are seven tasks to perform immediately before entering the water to commence surveys (Table 1).

## _Performing a stereo-DOV survey_

Table 2 provides a list of the roles and responsibilities of the diver operating the stereo-DOV and their buddy diver. As a general principle, do not start surveys if visibility is <5m as the ability to identify, count and measure individuals from video imagery will be compromised. When swimming each transect, it is important to follow the target habitat/benthos with the cameras pointing straight ahead (Fig. 1). Do not turn the cameras to the side to capture interesting fish or events, as this will bias the survey.

It is important to include a calibration check by filming a scale bar at increasing distances out to ~10 m whilst in the field to confirm accuracy of measurements, particularly if cameras were replaced. Measure the length of this scale-bar back in the lab to assess the accuracy of measurements. 


## _After each stereo-DOV survey dive_

Dry housings then remove the cameras and check that memory card and battery life is sufficient for another dive. Turn the cameras off to preserve the battery life for the following dive and record the GPS location and additional essential metadata (Supp. 3).  


## Downloading and storing video

At the end of each day, download all videos and save with a clear folder and naming convention. Folders could include the campaign ID, date, site and camera numbers (see supp. 3 for examples). Labelling these folders by sample and camera number (e.g. NCB521_leftcam3) can assist in managing data. Once all data are downloaded, create backups on separate hard-drives and store separately. Transcribe all field data sheets into a digital copy. Only after videos have been downloaded, backed up and checked should you format memory cards for re-use. 


## Analysing video for fish abundance and length

The use of specialist software to extract abundance and species information from videos can decrease analysis time and transcribing errors when compared to generic video players and spreadsheets. To extract length measurements, specialised software is needed to calibrate the cameras and to make length measurements e.g. the Vision Measurement System (Harman et al., 2003), NIH Image [(Dunbrack, 2006)](https://paperpile.com/c/RsmHLu/Z9xQ), MatLab (Boynton &  Cos, 2006), Python (Williams et al., 2018) or the StereoMorph package in R (Olsen and Westneat 2015).Detailed information on how length measurements are calculated can be found in <span style="text-decoration:underline;">(Shortis et al., 2009)</span>. EventMeasure ([www.seagis.com.au](http://www.seagis.com.au)) has become the most commonly used specialist software for stereo-video analysis [(Whitmarsh et al., 2017)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/0NbYA) and relies on pre-populated lists to avoid transcribing/spelling errors. It also includes a video player that facilitates increased playback speeds, and advanced functionality allowing for the extraction of a broad range of data.  Identification, counting and measurement processes using EventMeasure are described below, however, care has been taken to describe the processes more generally so that they are relevant to other software/programs.

We recommend that all fish species are identified, counted, and measured, however, it is possible to analyse a subset of species to reduce time (e.g. fishery-targeted). . We also recommend measuring fork rather than total length, as it is more easily definable across a broader range of species. To ensure accurate and repeatable estimates of length, measurements that exceed a certain error limit or fall outside of a defined sampling area should be rejected.  The residual mean square (RMS) error should be set to a maximum of 20 mm, the ratio of precision of the measurement to the length of a fish at 10% and the maximum distance that lengths can be made at 8 m, or at the minimum visibility of a survey for standardisation. To ensure all fish are within a 5 m wide belt transect, measurements will need to be rejected if they are further than 2.5 m either side of the camera.  In EventMeasure these can be pre-set as length-based rules and should be checked prior to beginning analysis (Supp. 4).

For each site surveyed (typically each dive) a new measurement file (.EMObs in EventMeasure) should be created and a unique sample code entered, matching the metadata on the field/lab-sheet (Supp. 3). When starting analysis, the left and right cameras must be synchronised to the nearest frame, using the ‘clap’ captured at the start of the video footage to keep stereo images synchronised. At the beginning of each transect, a ‘period’ should be defined corresponding to the transect number. Identify the first fish and measure its length, ensuring that the measurement is obtained when the fish is straight, and perpendicular to the cameras (preferably at an angle less than 45°), with the head and tail visible in both images. If the fish cannot be measured, annotate using a ‘_3D point’_, which logs the location and ensures it is included in abundance measures. Lengths and 3D points are summed to determine abundance, and when calculating biomass, the 3D point data provides a basis for extrapolating the median length values to fish that could not be measured ([Wilson et al., 2018)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/DT8H). It is important that all video analysts work collaboratively and maintain regular dialogue to ensure identifications are consistent. A reference image library will assist with identifications and should be built upon as you analyse by collecting appropriate and verified images and videos. Some genera cannot be consistently identified to species level from video so are recorded at genus/family levels (e.g. flathead: _Platycephalus _spp). If you cannot identify a fish to species level but think someone else may later, label it as sp1, 2, 3 etc, retain an image/video and ensure each analyst is aware of the same naming convention. This permits a batch-rename at a later stage. 

Identify and measure every fish that is observed on each transect. When it is not possible or feasible to measure the entirety of a large school, measure as many fish as possible, ensuring those measured represent the size range of the school, and enter a 3D point with the number of fish that could not be measured. The biomass of unmeasured fish can be accounted for following the method outlined in [Wilson, Graham et al., (2018)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/DT8H). Once a transect is finished, define the end of the period and repeat these steps for all the remaining transects. When analysis of the video has been completed, save and record the date of completion in the lab-sheet (highlighted in blue in Supp. 3).


## Analysing fish behaviour from video

Stereo-DOV can provide a measurement of fish wariness, using a proxy known as ‘minimum approach distance’ ([Lindfield et al., 2014; Goetze et al., 2017)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/aaTG+c1Yr). This is calculated by measuring fish when they are closest to the cameras. If a fish cannot be measured at its closest distance (i.e. is partly obscured), a distance measure (_3D point_) can be taken and added to the initial length measurement in a custom field. 


## Habitat analysis

Taxonomic composition, percent cover of benthos and rugosity/relief measures can be obtained from stereo-video imagery. For benthic classification, we recommend using TransectMeasure software ([www.seagis.com.au](http://www.seagis.com.au)) or online annotation tools such as BenthoBox (https://benthobox.com), with the CATAMI classification scheme for scoring marine biota [(Althaus et al., 2015)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/oXoP). Using TransectMeasure, it is possible to project a horizontal virtual-quadrat onto the substratum with randomly placed points superimposed for benthic identification [(Bennett et al., 2016)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/qeFU). The resulting benthic habitat data is comparable with more traditional techniques that use imagery perpendicular to the benthos [(Bennett et al., 2016)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/qeFU). It is also important to calculate a measure of complexity and relief alongside the biota classification, using the stereo-height and visual scoring methods presented in [Collins et al., (2017)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/5xIZ) and documented in an open-access repository ([https://github.com/TimLanglois/Habitat-annotation-of-forward-facing-benthic-imagery](https://github.com/TimLanglois/Habitat-annotation-of-forward-facing-benthic-imagery)). Finally, visibility can be calculated by making a 3D point measurement of an object (e.g. coral) at the maximum range of visibility. Together these methods enable rapid and effective assessments of fish–habitat relationships.

## Data outputs and management

Information on the length and abundance of fishes should be combined into a long format with each observation representing one row (in EventMeasure this output is known as “lengths and 3D points”). A separate file capturing all of the metadata (Supp. 3) and habitat data should also be compiled and stored with the fish data, and later linked in a relational database (e.g.[ https://globalarchive.org/](https://globalarchive.org/)). Before statistical analysis, data should be checked by someone with considerable experience in species identifications for that region. It is important to check the maximum and minimum lengths of all species of fishes to identify errors in species IDs or length measurements that were not picked up via the length rules. To assist in this process, location specific species lists should be compiled and used to prevent errors during the video analysis process (e.g. pre-loaded into EventMeasure) or after (e.g. data-outputs cross referenced with the list).
