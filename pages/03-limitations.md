It is important to consider whether a stereo-DOV survey is appropriate for answering the ecological question proposed given the method is prone to similar biases that arise with UVC e.g. the effects of divers on fish behaviour [(Dickens et al., 2011)](https://paperpile.com/c/RsmHLu/Zig1) and variation in the detectability of fish with different life histories [(Bernard et al., 2013; Kulbicki et al., 2010)](https://paperpile.com/c/RsmHLu/tTKq+2cNM). For example, there is increasing evidence that diver based surveys (using open-circuit SCUBA) may not be appropriate in areas with high spearfishing pressure, due to the behavioural bias of targeted fishes avoiding divers (Lindfield et al. 2014, [Gray et al., 2016)](https://paperpile.com/c/RsmHLu/QoQB). In areas with extreme fishing pressure, it may be more appropriate to use a remote technique such as baited remote underwater video (BRUVs). Transect-based UVC can also overestimate large mobile predators due to the lack of an “instantaneous” counts (Ward-Paige et al., 2010), although this can be reduced by the decreased survey times associated with stereo-DOVs (Goetze et al., 2015). Finally, stereo-DOVs are less effective for surveying cryptic species when compared to UVC, due to a decreased clarity of video compared to the human eye (Holmes et al., 2013). For details on the comparative advantages/disadvantages and species-specific biases of UVC, DOV and BRUV surveys see Goetze et al. (2015) with specific reference to Supp. 1, which provides a summary of published method comparisons.
