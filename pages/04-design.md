The construction of stereo-DOV systems (Fig. 2) requires design precision and rigidity to preserve stability that is essential for stereo-photogrammetry [(Shortis et al., 2009)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/gsjL). A robust design will improve the calibration of a stereo-DOV, needed to calculate accurate length and distance measurements [(Boutros et al., 2015)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/4Naa). Given the complexities involved with construction, we recommend purchasing stereo-DOV systems, calibration hardware and software from a recognised provider (e.g. [https://www.seagis.com.au](https://www.seagis.com.au/hardware.html)). If constructing your own stereo-DOVs, ensure that camera housings are securely mounted to a rigid base bar and cameras are secured within the housing so that they can be replaced in the exact same position. Any movement in these aspects will disrupt the stereo-calibration and result in measurement error. For this reason, most “off the shelf” housings are not suitable for stereo-DOVs unless modified. See Fig. 2k for an example of a camera that is secured to the housing faceplate to ensure stability.

Equipment required for stereo-DOV surveys; (a) stereo-DOV system, (b) stabilising arm/scale bar, (c) memory card reader, (d) cotton counter (also known as hip-chain), (e) spare camera and memory cards, (f) numbered tags, (g) spare cotton, (h) spare battery pack, (i) battery charger, (j) dive float and line and (k) camera secured to faceplate. 

We recommend cameras with full high definition resolution of at least 1920 x 1080 pixels [(Harvey et al., 2010)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/BAgc) and a capture rate of 60 frames per second. Increased camera resolution will improve your ability to locate, identify and measure fish, and a higher frame rate reduces the impact of a rolling shutter on length measurements. To ensure the accuracy and repeatability of length measurements, the camera must have an option to disable auto focus and video stabilisation, as these settings can invalidate stereo-video measurements and a fixed focal length can facilitate measurements both close to and far from the camera systems when calibrated properly [(Shortis et al., 2009, Boutros et al., 2015)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/4Naa). The field of view should also be set on no more than a medium angle (~95° H-FOV) to limit the distortion of imagery. The system pictured in Fig. 2 uses Sony FDR-X3000 cameras connected to an external power-bank, with camera housings separated by 800mm on an aluminium base bar (see Fig. 3). Cameras are inwardly converged at 4 degrees to provide an overlapping field of view for action cameras that generally have a wide field of view (Fig. 3). This combination of camera separation and angle will facilitate an increased accuracy of length measurements when compared to lower values [(Boutros et al., 2015)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/4Naa). The stabilising arm points straight ahead to assist divers in keeping the camera system parallel relative to the benthos (Fig. 1, Fig. 2b).

Important aspects for the design of a stereo-DOV system to ensure accuracy of length measurements and ease of use.

Prior to and following completion of a field campaign, stereo-DOVs require calibration to facilitate accurate and precise measurements. Further information on how to calibrate stereo-video systems is provided in [(Boutros et al., 2015)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/4Naa). 

_Transect length_

Similar to UVC methodology, the most common transect dimension when sampling   assemblages of non-cryptic reef associated fishes is 5 m x 50 m [(Samoilys & Carlos, 2000](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/gdUl)). However, a variety of transect lengths have been used dependent upon the target habitat, species and ecological question of interest. These should be considered before selecting an appropriate transect length and experimental design.
