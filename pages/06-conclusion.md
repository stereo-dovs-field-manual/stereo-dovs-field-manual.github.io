Stereo-DOVs facilitate the simultaneous collection of species identity, abundance, length, biomass, behaviour and habitat, and reduce observer error and time in the field. However, video analysis is still a time consuming and costly process that limits the uptake of video-based methodologies. Advances in machine learning and automation of video analysis appear promising in reducing these costs in the future [(Shortis et al., 2013)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/8QyO+OSaE+w9fx). While automation of the video analysis process will still require some manual quality control, its implementation will significantly decrease the time needed to assess and monitor fish assemblages over broad scales and further increase the use of stereo-DOVs. In areas where diver-based surveys are problematic (i.e. areas of high spearfishing pressure or deeper waters), remotely operated or autonomous vehicles that incorporate stereo-video systems may be an effective alternative. As such, the vast majority of the information and procedures described here will be applicable to these survey methodologies in the future as technology advances. An increase in the use of stereo-video surveys will facilitate compilation of comparable data over continental and global scales, and provide standardised and powerful information to apply to fisheries management and conservation.
