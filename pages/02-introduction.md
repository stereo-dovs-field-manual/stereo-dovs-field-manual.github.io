Our understanding of fish ecology and our ability to best manage fish populations requires accurate data on diversity, abundance and size. Visual surveys by SCUBA divers have become a widely used method to collect data on coastal fish assemblages [(Edgar & Stuart-Smith, 2014)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/DZcN+gdUl+xKfk). Underwater visual census (UVC), where a diver identifies and counts fishes within a predefined area [(Brock, 1954)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/WwBQ) or distance based sampling [(Kulbicki & Sarramégna, 1999)](https://paperpile.com/c/RsmHLu/s6WA), is a logistically simple, non-destructive, and usually cost-effective method of surveying fish. However, the effectiveness of UVC for reliable long-term monitoring is influenced by inter-observer variability [(Thompson & Mapstone, 1998)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/84OX) and inaccuracies in estimating the length of fish and sample areas [(Harvey, Fletcher, & Shortis, 2001; Harvey et al., 2004)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/s5qs+7tNa). In addition, the simultaneous identification, counting and size estimation of fish requires extensive training and experience (Williams et al., 2006). These limitations can be overcome or reduced through the incorporation of stereo-video into UVC surveys, i.e. diver operated stereo-video (stereo-DOV, Fig.1).

In some cases, stereo-DOVs can more accurately detect the impacts of fishing when compared to UVC, partly due to a decrease in survey time providing a more accurate snapshot of fish density when compared to transect-based UVC (Goetze et al., 2015). Rather than relying on _in-situ_ identification and length estimates, collected video can be annotated off-site, reducing time in the field and/or enabling greater spatial coverage. In addition, stereo-DOVs simultaneously collect information on the abundance, length and behaviour of fishes [(Lindfield et al., 2014; Goetze et al., 2017)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/c1Yr+aaTG) as well as quantifying habitat type and complexity [(Saunders et al., 2014; Bennett et al., 2016; Collins et al., 2017)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/0wYj+5xIZ+qeFU). These benefits, in addition to a reduction in the size and cost of video cameras have fuelled an exponential increase in the uptake of stereo-DOVs over the last decade [(e.g. Shalders et al.,  2018; Goetze et al., 2015; Goetze et al., 2017;)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/0wYj+T9dj+ZmuK+sZyD+irdI).

The most common application of stereo-DOVs involves swimming along a transect [(Saunders et al., 2014; Shedrawi et al., 2014; Goetze et al., 2015)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/tSM1+xrEx+0wYj), but the method has been applied in a variety of ways around the world, and to date there are no clear guidelines or standards for researchers looking to effectively utilise stereo-DOVs. Standardised approaches for UVC (e.g. [Samoilys & Carlos, 2000)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/gdUl) were not published until well after the method was first described by Brock ([1954)](https://paperpile.com/c/4hIsZv/WwBQ), which has resulted in a vast number of variations in methodology and reduced the capacity to synthesis data on a global scale (Caldwell et al., 2016). Here, we provide a comprehensive guide for researchers using stereo-DOVs to survey fish assemblages using a standard transect approach, including information on stereo-DOV design, field operation and video analysis. By providing a standardised set of procedures for stereo-DOV surveys, we aim to reduce variation in methodologies across researchers and increase the capacity to synthesise data to answer broad-scale ecological questions.
